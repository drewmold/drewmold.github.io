<p>I want to build a website where people may come and have an easy and understandable way of seeing all the trails and hikes in the area. It will be a social platform where users can upload their own suggestions and advice for specific hikes. It will be a differ from all the other sites because this one would give them access to the interaction with others who can give real time advice. What better way to find your group of adventure friends than an online hiking suggestion website? As you  can see it will help so many hikers come together and appreciate the great outdoors.</p>  <!-- change this -->
